## Summary

## Steps

### Opening the RPGWizard
After you've downloaded and extracted the zip folder, look for the editor **.exe** file. In the same folder you will also find the *plugins* and *projects* folders. To start the editor you simply need to run the **.exe**.

The engine will open up the current game project inside an embedded engine on Windows, or on Linux it will use the default web browser.

Once you get past the loading screen you can use your keyboard's arrow keys or W, A, S, and D to move around:
